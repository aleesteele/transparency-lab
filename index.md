<h1 class="title-intro">Welcome to the Atlas of Extractive Industries</h1>

<div class="title-description">
 Faced with increasingly knowledgeable consumers and widespread revelations about the social and ecological impact of resource extraction, the mining industry has adopted new trading standards and imposed changes to its governing bodies. In recent years, the numbers of initiatives, certification schemes, voluntary standards and sector-specific regulations have multiplied exponentially. The Atlas of Extractive Industries is a visual representation of these embedded networks of regulation. The Atlas is a product of the Transparency Lab at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva.
