The RJC COP defines the responsible ethical, human rights, social and environmental practices throughout the jewellry and watch supply chains. It draws on existing guidelines such the OECD for due diligence and the GRI for reporting. All certified RJC members must adhere to the COP and work to implement its 42 provisions. The COP lies in between standard and certification since members can display membership without being accredited. Third party auditing and certification only becomes mandatory after two years, and can be granted including without full conformance.
