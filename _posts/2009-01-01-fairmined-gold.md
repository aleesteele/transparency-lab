This standard  is directed  at  community  based  Artisanal  and  Small-Scale  Mining  Organizations (ASMOs)  comprising  of  all  possible  forms  of  organizations  that  they  may  constitute. Fairmined ASMOs are certified through third party auditing, and Fairmined licensees (retailers of Fairmined labelled products) are certified upon full physical traceability (unlike Fair Trade Gold) through third party auditing. The standard aligns with the OECD guidance and regulations such as ILO and the Minamata convention. A premium is paid to the Fairmined producer depending on whether it complies with the Fairmined golf or Fairmined ecological gold.
