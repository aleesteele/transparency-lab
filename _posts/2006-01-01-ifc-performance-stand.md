These standards are designed for IFC clients to avoid, mitigate and manage risks and impacts as a way of doing business in a sustainable way, and to develop their overall environmental and social management through the Standards and IFC advisory support.

IFC clients must provide an Annual Monitoring Report on their progress in meeting the standards, which are assessed and monitored by IFC.
