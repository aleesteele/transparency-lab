The Standard establishes a set of well-defined   environmental, ecological, social responsibility and human health metrics as an indicator of leadership in sustainability performance. It applies to all processors of natural stone, from quarry operations through final stone fabrication, both in domestic (US) and international markets. The quarrier and processor will need to obtain the standard compliance, chain of custody and conformance document by a third-party auditor in order to pursue certification.
