ASI’s standards are voluntary and apply to all stages of aluminium production and transformation, specifically: bauxite mining, alumina refining, primary aluminium production, semi-fabrication (rolling, extrusion, forging and foundry), material conversion, and refining and re-melting of recycled scrap. The scope of CoC Certification is defined by the Entity seeking Certification and includes all Facilities (and where applicable, Outsourcing Contractors) used for the processing, accounting, shipping and/or receiving of CoC Material.
