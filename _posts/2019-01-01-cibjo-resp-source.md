The guidance standardizes how jewellery and gemstone firms should implement supply-chain due diligence. It follows the framework of the OECD Guidance, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and requires compliance to the World Diamond Council System of Warranties Guidelines for diamonds (i.e. extension of KPC compliance to polished diamonds).
