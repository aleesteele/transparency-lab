The standard is voluntary and applies to operational steelmaking sites and to related sites that process raw materials for steelmaking, or that produce steel product - not to service providers, mine sites, or to sites producing final products. It comprises 12 principles for the responsible sourcing and production that cover sustainability issues at large. Policies can be developed at the group/corporate owner level, and not necessarily at the site level, but third party auditing verifies implementation until sites (both mines for raw material and scrap) upon which a certification decision is taken.
