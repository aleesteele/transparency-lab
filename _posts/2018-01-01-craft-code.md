CRAFT is a tool that facilitates the comprehension, application, and commitment to due diligence by all stakeholders in artisanal supply chains. It enables the identification and mitigation of risks existing in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, and supports progressive improvement in environmental and social performance. It aims to facilitate ASM products to access formal supply chains and possibly apply for an external certification.

Participants to a CRAFT scheme must produce CRAFT report along the OECD framework implemented in CRAFT's performance indicators. CRAFT Schemes have no obligation to carry out any due diligence or verification of the content of CRAFT Reports, but can use them for certification by other schemes.
