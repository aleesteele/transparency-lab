{% include page-desc.html %}

Operating set of health, safety, social and environmental standards for coal producers against which their performance is assessed to jointly develop a continuous improvement plan.

{% include page-req.html %}

Bettercoal members conduct self-assessment (1-2 years) and undergo a third party assessment (1-5 years) of their performance against the twelve principles of the Bettercoal Code. Assessment does not provide a certification of performance but instead drives a model of continuous improvement.
