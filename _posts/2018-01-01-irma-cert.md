IRMA’s Standard defines good practices for what responsible mining should look like at the industrial-scale mine site level (business integrity, planning, social responsibility, environmental responsibility) that independent auditors will use as the benchmark for responsible mines. IRMA offers third-party certification of industrial-scale mine sites for all mined materials that is governed equitably by the private sector, local communities, civil society, and workers.

IRMA certification is based on third-party auditing of industrial-scale mine sites; the scope of the audit depends on the life stage of the mine. Besides certification, IRMA issues lower "verified level achievements".
