The Standard aims to help gold producers to demonstrate that their gold has been extracted in a manner that does not fuel conflict or the abuse of human rights associated with such conflicts by operationalising the OECD guidance at the level of mines. Conformance with the standard is externally assured and is not a prerequisite for WGC membership.
