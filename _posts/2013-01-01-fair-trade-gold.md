The standard for Gold and Associated Precious Metals for ASSM covers the requirements that need to be complied within order to participate in the Fairtrade system. It applies to legal artisanal and small-scale mining organizations (ASMO, including landowner, legal owner, members, shareholders) of various types, including community based ASMO, as well as to traders and refiners (with a focus on traceability, possibly mass balanced). It refers to various regulations (ILO, Dodd-Franc), guidelines (OCDE), and other gold certification (LBMA). Certification is based upon the fair trade system and granted upon third party auditing by FLOCERT, which allows for a premium price, possibly supplemented by an ecological premium.
